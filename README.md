# Gn Disk
A hologram game with Leap Motion controls. 

Gluten Disk is an arcade style shooter hack where players use the Leap Motion to shoot at a moving target seen through a Pepper's Ghost illusion. We are using Three.js to render a 3D scene and showing that scene and allow players to really see and aim in three dimensions with the Leap Motion.

In the future we would need a larger Prism and screen to increase the view area, and obtain a second leap motion so the other player can be controlled.
